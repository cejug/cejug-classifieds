      When we think about educational institutions, one of most traditional 
      ways of measuring understanding is the use of questions, organized in 
      assignments and tests. Teachers around the world share the challenge 
      of creating a good set of questions about their subjects and also 
      that of updating this database periodically to avoid repetitive or 
      obsolete questionnaires--a demanding and time-consuming task.

      On the other hand, students are supposed to use a question collection in
      order to improve their skills or, at least, to prove they have learned
      the subject at hand. Observation of the behavior of teachers facing this 
      challenge suggests us the need of a tool to facilitate their work. At 
      first sight, the design of such a tool may seem vague and complicated, 
      but teachers with classroom experience share a strong feeling about the 
      requirements of such a tool. Combining these viewpoints with some 
      software-engineering concepts can be a nice guide for the development of 
      Quaestio, the question-management module of the Schoolbus Project.
