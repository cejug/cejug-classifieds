			<para>
				When we think about educational institutions, one of most
				traditional
				ways of measuring understanding is the use of questions,
				organized
				in
				assignments and tests. Teachers around the world share
				the challenge
				of creating a good set of questions about their
				subjects and also
				that of updating this database periodically to
				avoid repetitive or
				obsolete questionnaires--a demanding and
				time-consuming task. 
    </para>
			<para>
				On the other hand, students are supposed to use a question
				collection
				in
				order to improve their skills or, at least, to prove
				they have learned
				the subject at hand. Observation of the behavior of
				teachers facing
				this
				challenge suggests us the need of a tool to
				facilitate their work. At
				first sight, the design of such a tool may
				seem vague and complicated,
				but teachers with classroom experience
				share a strong feeling about
				the
				requirements of such a tool.
				Combining these viewpoints with some
				software-engineering concepts
				can be a nice guide for the
				development of
				Quaestio, the
				question-management module of the Schoolbus Project.
